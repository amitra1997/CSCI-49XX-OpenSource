c.1. It seems as though the main themes are for Open Source Software to be open to all who want it, a universal license that automatically applies to all users, and maintaining the original author's integrity.

c.2. Based on my experience, the best way to answer a question is to first understand yourself exactly what is going on. Then you are able to form a specific answer. Another helpful suggestion is to understand why the person asking the question is having trouble with the concept, and using tools such as pneumonics answers easier to digest.

c.3. In this chapter, an RPI student begins to tinker with search engine technology. He built a search engine for all of RPI's work. This search engine was a simple modification of other engines, however better optimized and more bug-free. Then he was contacted by the dean of students, who pursued legal action against him, similar to other universities. I believe that targeting in society happens quite frequently, and is directed at the wrong people. It is important through this to stand up and fight for what is important. All Jesse had done was built a superior search engine. He should be rewarded for his feat.

g.4. I know that I am interested greatly in databases, as I have just taken Database Systems two semesters ago. With that theoretical foundation, I would like to apply it to a functional purpose now, by building some sort of database. I am not quite sure which projects exist out there to pursue such an interest, and am using Google and resources provided by the professor, along with RCOS to find some projects that may be of interest. Specifically, I would like to formulate a database that has a strong application, so that its purpose is valued in the community. Beyond that, I will continue to look for new projects that week, specifically in relaiton to databases, and narrow down my options. If nothing seems suitable, I may create an entirely new project on my own, or change my course of direction.
