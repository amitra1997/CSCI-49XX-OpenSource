## Blog Post
I am writing the blog post here as the project is already in active development by RCOS, and I would not like to create a new blog post without permission. 

So far, I have cloned the repository, installed necessary components to run, and ran the repository on a local iOS simulator using my Macbook Pro. After I got the program working, I began sifting through the existing codebase, trying to learn and understand it. At this point, I have a solid understanding of the frontend, and am still working on fully understanding the backend, as I have not used NodeJS in the past. Starting next week, I intend to begin making contributions to the project codebase.

Note: Since writing the blog post above, I have switched groups to Custom Key RGB.
