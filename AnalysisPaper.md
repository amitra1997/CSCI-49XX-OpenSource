## Part 1

### 1. Submitty
(https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty)

Submitty is RPI's open source program assignment submission system.

Evaluation Factor | Level (0-2) | Evaluation Data 
|:-|:-:|:-|
| **Licensing** | 2 | Submitty uses the BSD 3-Clause License, which is approved by the OSI |
| **Language** | 1 | 1. PHP: 32.2% :: 2. HTML: 22.8% :: 3. JavaScript: 15.3% |
| **Level of Activity** | 2 | All 4 quarters in the last year were active |
| **Number of Contributors** | 2 | Submitty has 69 contributors |
| **Product Size** | 2 | Submitty is 36.52 MB | 
| **Issue Tracker** | 2 | Issues are actively being added and resolved |
| **New Contributor** | 1 | There is a "How to Contribute" page present with information on coding style, commits, reviewing and submitting pull requests, and edit the codebase. Instructions to download and install are present, as well as a link to the Submitty slack channel. The README also contains basic information about the project, features, and motivations. However, developer documentation is not as feature-rich as it could be. https://submitty.org/developer/how_to_contribute |
| **Community Norms** | 1 | There is no Code of Conduct. Communication is primarily handled through Slack, which does not contain rude or inappropriate behavior. Communication is not as frequent as expected, given the size of the project. The community seems to primarily communicate through issues and requests on git, rather than through Slack. |
| **User Base** | 2 | The user base is RPI students taking coding classes, and their corresponding Professors/TAs who post and grade those homeworks with the assistance of Submitty. The instructions to download and utilize the software are clear and easy to access. Use of the software is also easy to find and understand. |
| **Total Score** | - | 15 |

### 2. YACS
(https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs)

YACS is RPI's open source class scheduling system.

Evaluation Factor | Level (0-2) | Evaluation Data 
|:-|:-:|:-|
| **Licensing** | 2 | YACS uses the GNU Affero General Public License, which is approved by the OSI |
| **Language** | 1 | 1. Ruby: 51.9% :: 2. TypeScript: 16.8% :: 3. JavaScript: 11.1% |
| **Level of Activity** | 2 | All 4 quarters in the last year were active |
| **Number of Contributors** | 2 | YACS has 31 contributors |
| **Product Size** | 2 | YACS is 19.22 MB | 
| **Issue Tracker** | 2 | Issues are actively being added and resolved |
| **New Contributor** | 1 | There is a "Setup Guide" page present with information on installing, setting up and running Submitty. https://yacs.io/#/contributors/setup_guide Communication mechanisms may exist, however I was unable to find them after a long search. Additionally, I was unable to find a discussion platform for the project. There is a nice getting started page for new users to be able to jump in and contribute with ease, however. https://yacs.io/#/contributors/getting_started |
| **Community Norms** | 1 | There is a Code of Conduct, which includes no discrimination on the basis of sex, race, or otherwise uncontrollable characteristics. Welcoming and encouraging new developers is emphasized in the CoC. Finally, avenues to report and correct unacceptable behaviors are readily available. Communication is primarily handled through git, which does not contain rude or inappropriate behavior. Beyond that, there does not seem to be communication avenues such as Slack that are easily accessible and available to users, unless users have access to the official RCOS slack. |
| **User Base** | 2 | The user base is RPI students looking to schedule courses. One thing to note is that users do not use this often, but rather only about twice a year when forming schedules for the upcoming academic semester. Given the clunky and hard-to-use design of RPI's SIS scheduling, this tool is greatly appreciated and utilized by nearly the entire student body to form and compare schedules. The instructions to download and utilize the software are clear and easy to access. Use of the software is also easy to find and understand. |

### 3. Chromium
(https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src)
Official github mirror: (https://github.com/chromium/chromium)

Chromium is a lightweight web browser utilizing sandbox security.

| **Licensing** | 2 | Chromium uses the BSD 3-Clause License, which is approved by the OSI |
| **Language** | 2 | 1. C++ :: 2. Webcore :: 3. JavaScript (Percentages not available due to extremely large codebase size) |
| **Level of Activity** | 2 | All 4 quarters in the last year were active |
| **Number of Contributors** | 2 | Chromium has an infinite symbol for number of contributors (too many to display) |
| **Product Size** | 1 | Chromium is 12.15 GB, far too large for my purposes and understanding within the scope of this class | 
| **Issue Tracker** | 2 | Issues are actively being added and resolved |
| **New Contributor** | 2 | https://www.chromium.org/developers This page contains everything needed for new developers, including downloading and installing the environment, learning and getting around the codebase, communication mechanisms and discussion groups, and the Web presence.  |
| **Community Norms** | 2 | There is a Code of Conduct, which begins by informing users to be respectful and constructive. https://www.chromium.org/conduct Harassment is defined clearly and concisely. Finally, avenues to report and correct unacceptable behaviors are readily available, along with information on consequences of failing to comply with the CoC.

## Part 2
In this section I further analyze Submitty.

### Goal
Submitty strives to build a homework submission, automated grading and TA/instructor grading system. 

### Significance
Submitty is one of the most impactful open source projects on campus at RPI. Every student who takes a computer science course with code homework submission uses it to quickly and reliably submit homework assignments for grading. TAs and Professors depend on the software to automatically grade these assignments accurately when applicable, while also screening all assignments for plagiarism. Given that computer science is the largest single major declared on RPI's campus, Submitty's scope of usage is very large. It saves students and TAs/Professors hours of work in hand grading. It provides an easy way to submit homework, with quick and automated feedback to avoid unnecessary confusion. Submitty's importance to the computer science department at Rensselaer can not be emphasized enough.

### Personal Appeal
Although Submitty did not score as highly as Chromium when using the foss2serve rubric, I still found it to be the most appealing project. There are certain categories I value far more than others, such as scope of the project (project size) and personal affinity to the project (user base), even though on the foss2serve rubric all categories are ranked equally from 0 to 2. I would like to contribute to a project in a way where I can make a significant impact, to a user base that I care about. Submitty offers that solution. While the language it is written in may not be ideal for my purposes, I have confidence that I can quickly learn and adapt.
