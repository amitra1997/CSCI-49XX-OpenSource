| **Licensing** | 2 | Submitty uses the BSD 3-Clause License, which is approved by the OSI |
| **Language** | 1 | 1. PHP: 32.2% :: 2. HTML: 22.8% :: 3. JavaScript: 15.3% |
| **Level of Activity** | 2 | All 4 quarters in the last year were active |

| **Product Size** | 2 | Submitty is 36.52 MB | 
| **Issue Tracker** | 2 | Issues are actively being added and resolved |
| **New Contributor** | 1 | There is a "How to Contribute" page present with information on coding style, commits, reviewing and submitting pull requests, and edit the codebase. Instructions to download and install are present, as well as a link to the Submitty slack channel. The README also contains basic information about the project, features, and motivations. However, developer documentation is not as feature-rich as it could be. https://submitty.org/developer/how_to_contribute |
| **Community Norms** | 1 | There is no Code of Conduct. Communication is primarily handled through Slack, which does not contain rude or inappropriate behavior. Communication is not as frequent as expected, given the size of the project. The community seems to primarily communicate through issues and requests on git, rather than through Slack. |
| **User Base** | 2 | The user base is RPI students taking coding classes, and their corresponding Professors/TAs who post and grade those homeworks with the assistance of Submitty. The instructions to download and utilize the software are clear and easy to access. Use of the software is also easy to find and understand. |
| **Total Score** | - | 15 |

### 2. YACS

YACS is RPI's open source class scheduling system.

| **Language** | 1 | 1. Ruby: 51.9% :: 2. TypeScript: 16.8% :: 3. JavaScript: 11.1% |

| **Issue Tracker** | 2 | Issues are actively being added and resolved |
| **New Contributor** | 1 | There is a "Setup Guide" page present with information on installing, setting up and running Submitty. https://yacs.io/#/contributors/setup_guide Communication mechanisms may exist, however I was unable to find them after a long search. Additionally, I was unable to find a discussion platform for the project. There is a nice getting started page for new users to be able to jump in and contribute with ease, however. https://yacs.io/#/contributors/getting_started |
| **Community Norms** | 1 | There is a Code of Conduct, which includes no discrimination on the basis of sex, race, or otherwise uncontrollable characteristics. Welcoming and encouraging new developers is emphasized in the CoC. Finally, avenues to report and correct unacceptable behaviors are readily available. Communication is primarily handled through git, which does not contain rude or inappropriate behavior. Beyond that, there does not seem to be communication avenues such as Slack that are easily accessible and available to users. |
| **User Base** | 2 | The user base is RPI students looking to schedule courses. Given the clunky and hard-to-use design of RPI's SIS scheduling, this tool is greatly appreciated and utilized by nearly the entire student body to form and compare schedules. The instructions to download and utilize the software are clear and easy to access. Use of the software is also easy to find and understand. |
| **Total Score** | - | 15 |
